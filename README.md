Placx Simple Project & Task Visualization
=========================================

This was my 'weekend of code' project to develop an easy to use, 
low-requirement application for visually managing projects and tasks. 
The system runs off PHP + JSON (no database required!) and installs 
in about the same amount of time it takes to copy it to your server.

Installation
============

Simply copy all files and directories to the web server and ensure the
'/data' directory has write permisions.

The password to access the system initially is 'welcome'
